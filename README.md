# ComputerVision-Ex3

## Part 1: Computation of the Fundamental Matrix F
  1. Compute the fundamental matrix F from a pair of normalized images with at least 8 corresponding points
  2. Draw the epipolar lines on both images
  
## running instructions:
  ### Part1: run on example
  1. download all files to single folder 
  2. run from cmd example: python ./find_fundamental_matrix.py
  
## Part 2:
  1. 	Show how the linear triangulation method extends to n>2 images
  2.  Derive a method for triangulation in the case of pure translational motion of the cameras
